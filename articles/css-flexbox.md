# Understanding CSS Flexbox

CSS Flexbox, or the Flexible Box Layout, is a layout module that helps create responsive designs. It allows developers to design complex layouts more efficiently and with less code than traditional methods such as floats or positioning.

## What is Flexbox?

Flexbox provides a way to align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic. This is particularly useful for building responsive web pages that adjust to different screen sizes.

## Key Properties

1. **Flex Container**: The parent element that contains flex items. To enable flexbox on a container, you simply apply the `display: flex;` property.

2. **Flex Items**: The child elements of a flex container. You can control their size, spacing, and alignment using various flex properties.

3. **Main Axis and Cross Axis**: Flexbox has a main axis and a cross axis. The main axis is the direction in which the flex items are laid out (either horizontally or vertically), while the cross axis runs perpendicular to it.

## Flexbox in Action

Hereâ€™s a simple example of using Flexbox:

```css
.container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
}

.item {
    flex: 1; /* Makes items grow equally */
}
